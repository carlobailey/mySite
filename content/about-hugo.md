I'm Carlo â€“ an architect turned data scientist and developer. I currently work as a lead research scientist at [Topos Inc](https://topos.com/). My recent work has focused on developing recommendation systems, predictive models and workflow automation tools for the real estate industry.

I previously worked in the R&D team at [WeWork](https://www.wework.com/) and have taught graduate classes at Columbia University.

With a graduate degree in architecture & computational design, I'm particularly interested in utilizing advanced statistical methods in solving problems in the built environment and cities.
