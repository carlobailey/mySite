I'm Carlo â€“ an architect turned data scientist and developer. I currently work as a senior data scientist at [VTS](https://www.vts.com/) and am an adjunct professor at Columbia University's [GSAPP](https://www.arch.columbia.edu/). My recent work has focused on developing recommendation systems, predictive models and workflow automation tools for the commercial real estate industry.

Previously I was part of the data science team at [Topos Inc](https://topos.com/),the R&D team at [WeWork](https://www.wework.com/) and have taught graduate classes at CUNY.

With a graduate degree in architecture & computational design, I'm particularly interested in utilizing advanced statistical methods in solving problems in the built environment and cities.
